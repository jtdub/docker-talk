# Docker Talk

## Dockerfile review

Docker is a containerization technology that allows developers to package and deploy applications in a repeatable manner.

Docker containers are built from instructions in a `Dockerfile`. The `Dockerfile` tells docker what image to use to build the container, what packages to construct the container with, and how to run the application in the container.

## Building an image

Here is an example of a `Dockerfile`
```
# This tells Docker to use the Debian (Buster) based
# image loaded with Python 3.8.
FROM python:3.8-buster

# This tells Docker to execute `pip install flask`
# to install the flask python package while
# building the image.
RUN pip install flask

# This specifies the directory which to work out of.
WORKDIR /src

# This tells Docker to copy `app.py` from the host
# OS to the container in the `/src` directory.
COPY app.py .

# This is the command that Docker will execute
# while running the container.
CMD python /src/app.py
```

The `docker build` command tells docker to build a container from the instructions in the `Dockerfile`. There are many options that can be invoked to build an image. The `-t` option is the most common. The `-t` option, or `--tag` option allows the user to diferentiate and version container images.

```

To run a simple container, the arguments `-i`, or `--interactive`, `-t`, or `--tty`, and `--name` are the most common minimum arguments.
```
% docker run -it --name ntc-demo ntc-docker-app-demo:01
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Running a container with these arguments keeps your terminal locked to the container STDOUT. In another terminal, you can see the status of the container. You can also attempt to connect to the containers listening TCP port, but will be unable to, since we haven't exposed a port for the docker container to listen to.

```
% docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

% curl localhost:5000
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 5000: Connection refused
```
## Exposing a container to the world

To expose the containers tcp port to external environments, will need to allow the port to be exposed in the `Dockerfile`, build a new image, and then run the new image; telling docker to expose the port.

In the `Dockerfile`, a new instruction will need to be added, telling docker to expose a tcp/ip port to the container. I've also modified the `Dockerfile` for a couple flask specific arguments.

```
FROM python:3.8-buster

RUN pip install flask

WORKDIR /src

COPY app.py .

ENV FLASK_APP=/src/app.py

EXPOSE 5000/tcp

CMD python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```
With the `Dockerfile` modified, the docker image can be updated with the new instruction sets.

```

With the image upated, the old container can be stopped. Since we executed the container in interactive mode and didn't detatch from the container, we can use CNTRL-C to stop the container and then use the `docker rm` to remove the container.

```
% docker rm ntc-demo
ntc-demo
```

Now we can start up the new container, adding the `-p` or `--publish` flag to expose the tcp/ip port that we wish to expose to the outside world.

```
% docker run -it --name ntc-demo -p 5000:5000 ntc-docker-app-demo:02
 * Serving Flask app "/src/app.py"

   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

With the updated container running, we can use another terminal to see that docker is exposing the tcp/ip port.

```
% docker ps -a

## Mounting external volumes to a container

It's often handy to be able to have data read on storage that's external to the container. It can make the container smaller and can make the container more flexible. The downside is that the container can only run on hosts that have access to the data that the container needs to access.

To simulate this, we'll offload the data that the flask app uses and store it as a json file outside of the container.

Code before change:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import json
from flask import Flask


app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["POST"])
def get_balance():
	data = [
		{"id": 1, "name": "joe", "balance": 10},
		{"id": 2, "name": "bob", "balance": -1},
		{"id": 3, "name": "fred", "balance": 40},
	]

	return json.dumps(data, indent=4)


if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run()
```

JSON file:

```
% cat ./data/data.json
[
    {"id": 1, "name": "joe", "balance": 10},
    {"id": 2, "name": "bob", "balance": -1},
    {"id": 3, "name": "fred", "balance": 40}
]
```

Code after change:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import json
from flask import Flask


app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["POST"])
def get_balance():

	with open("./data/data.json") as f:
		data = json.loads(f.read())

	return json.dumps(data, indent=4)


if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run()
```

With the JSON data pulled out and the code modified, we just need to update the image.

Now, when we run the container, we need to specify the external volume to mount. This is done with the `-v` or `--volume` argument.
```
% docker run -it --name ntc-demo -p 5000:5000 -v ${PWD}/data:/src/data ntc-docker-app-demo:03
 * Serving Flask app "/src/app.py"
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
`${PWD}/data` maps the local data path to the container `/src/data` path.

Issuing a `curl` should result in the same result as the previous test.
```

## Getting containers to talk to each other
Docker containers can communicate to other containers. By default, all containers are spun up on `bridge` network (172.17.0.0/16).
```
% docker network inspect bridge
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "6cf132e1e0b4db3c54c610e0fd5166f57d8f8d5827a9f29429da129019e51864",
        "Created": "2020-11-11T21:41:55.799662895Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": null,
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {},
        "Options": {
            "com.docker.network.bridge.default_bridge": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.name": "docker0",
            "com.docker.network.driver.mtu": "1500"
        },
        "Labels": {}
    }
]
```
Any container on this network can ping and communicate with any other container by IP. If the containers know the name of another container on the network, it can ping it by name as well.

To test this, spin up two containers. The second container will utilize the `--link` flag to specify the name of another container to connect to.
```
% docker run -itd --name ntc1 ntc-docker-app-demo:03
ab94eb0c4f39cf22548d7d960e837fb10e1f94f4ae272eb03cd1b8b612eff2a5
% docker run -itd --name ntc2 --link ntc1 ntc-docker-app-demo:03
19ff532dd5988d3e28249c64ba087cad9009de6731ba9c506f4897a90c405f6b
```
Connect to the shell of the second container.
```
% docker exec -it ntc2 bash
```
In the shell you will notice that the containers `/etc/hosts` was updated with the entry of `ntc1`. Docker performed this action when the `--link` argument was passed.
```
root@19ff532dd598:/src# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1	localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0	ip6-localnet

ff02::2	ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.2	ntc1 ab94eb0c4f39
172.17.0.3	19ff532dd598
```
This allows you to communicate with the neighboring container by name.
```

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.089/0.185/0.281/0.096 ms
```
DNS, however, does not know how to resolve to `ntc1`:
```
root@19ff532dd598:/src# dig ntc1

```
The corresponding `ntc1` container does not know how to communicate with `ntc2` by name, because it was not spun up with the `--link` argument. The `--link` argument can not be issued until the container being linked exists. It can communicate with the corresponding container by IP, however.
```

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.126/0.193/0.235/0.050 ms
```
With that in mind, let's create a container that fetches the data from the `ntc-docker-app-demo` and presents some data.
```

The new app is simple. It simply performs an HTTP GET to `ntc1` and returns the results.
```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import json
import requests
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/", methods=["GET"])
def accounts():
	return json.dumps(requests.get('http://ntc1:5000').json(), indent=2)


if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run()
```
With the new image created, we can spin up the two containers and watch their interactions.
```
% docker run -itd --name ntc1 -v ${PWD}/data:/src/data ntc-docker-app-demo:03

bde63fa7ed47cb870ec93d57e9a9c46955947c436fda11d45613be5a716e4ef4
```
We can verify that the containers are running.
```
% docker ps -a

## Docker logs
Docker logs can be used to determine what is happening within a container. We can use the logs to see the network communications between `ntc1` and `ntc2` and the curl client to `ntc2`.
```
% docker logs ntc1

As you can see, `docker logs` can be useful for troubleshooting container problems.

## Docker-compose
Docker compose allows a user to define a suite of containers and orchestrate their lifecycle. The services are defined within a yaml file. Below is a docker-compose yaml file describing what we've done to this point, but all contained in the yaml file.
```yaml
% cat docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  ntc1:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
    - ${PWD}/data:/src/data
  ntc2:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile1
    ports:
    - "5000:5000"
    links:
    - "ntc1"
```
To spin up the containers, execute `docker-compose up`.
```
% docker-compose up

We can verify that the containers are running with the `docker ps -a` command. Within this command, you can also see that the `ntc2` container has tcp port 5000 exposed to the external network.
```
% docker ps -a

The same `curl` test can be performed to ensure that the apps are working properly.
```

```
To shutdown the containers, you can use CNTRL-C, if you haven't detached from the container sessions. If you're detached, you can use the `docker-compose down` command to tear down the containers.
```
^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping files_ntc2_1 ... done
Stopping files_ntc1_1 ... done
```

The docker-compose yaml file can be used to define a wide range of arguments for the containers, such as spinning up replicas to do load balancing with or restarting containers if they fail. Information of these arguments can be found on the [docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).

## Docker Swarm

Docker swarm is the docker equivelant of kubernetes. It's a container orchestration platform. It's not widely used as kubernetes has taken on the defacto orchestration platform for containers. [Play with Docker](http://play-with-docker.com/) is a quick and easy way to play with a docker swarm testbed.

First, initialize the docker swarm master on `node1`:
```
$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.0.28
Swarm initialized: current node (r5c3r3t8o3h71a1it6fns9ge7) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-5eut931plqesiizfe8txa18y5ur0sp1iqu2wacv4442s8f7ll3-92nkpybn7l96eubgwkwjz5f4y 192.168.0.28:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.28 ~
```
Next, on `node2` join the swarm.
```
$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-5eut931plqesiizfe8txa18y5ur0sp1iqu2wacv4442s8f7ll3-92nkpybn7l96eubgwkwjz5f4y 192.168.0.28:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
[node2] (local) root@192.168.0.27 ~
$ 
```
This same process can be followed for as many nodes as you want.
```
[node3] (local) root@192.168.0.26 ~
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-5eut931plqesiizfe8txa18y5ur0sp1iqu2wacv4442s8f7ll3-92nkpybn7l96eubgwkwjz5f4y 192.168.0.28:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
[node3] (local) root@192.168.0.26 ~
$ 
```
On `node1`, you should be able to see all the nodes in the swarm, with the `docker node` command.
```
$ docker node ls
ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS      ENGINE VERSION
r5c3r3t8o3h71a1it6fns9ge7 *   node1               Ready               Active              Leader              19.03.11
ryt6qsalextb8v5psf03qtmbk     node2               Ready               Active                                  19.03.11
1dunrhdc9a30iwo2869m6tx8q     node3               Ready               Active                                  19.03.11
[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.28 ~
$ 
```
I built the docker containers on `node1` and updated the `docker-compose.yml` file to just define the images. This is because docker swarm can't build the containers on the fly. It's relying on pre-built images.
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  ntc1:
    image: ntc1:latest
    ports:
    - "5000:5000"
```
```
$ docker build -t ntc1 .
